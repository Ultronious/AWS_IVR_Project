## 🚀 How to Import into AWS Lex

1. Open the **Amazon Lex Console**.  
2. Choose **Create bot → Import**.  
3. Upload the exported bot definition file (`AadhaarPhoneBot.json`).  
4. Review the intents and confirm they appear as `GetAadhaar` and `GetPhoneNumber`.  
5. Build and test the bot in the Lex console.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements
- Add **Lambda code hooks** for dynamic Aadhaar/phone number retrieval.  
- Integrate with a **backend database or API** for secure user verification.  
- Enable **multi-turn conversations** with slot elicitation.
